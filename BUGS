Currently, there is no single file tracking all the bugs in
TuxNES. Some are mentioned in README, and some are marked in the
sources with the string "FIXME". Since TuxNES is based on Nestra, some
of the following Nestra bugs are also present in TuxNES:


Known bugs in Nestra v0.66:

The following is a list of known problems in the current version of NEStra. 
Let me know if you have a fix for any of these problems, or if you find any
other bugs not listed here:

- A few cycle times aren't counted accurately.

- Self-modifying code doesn't always work right.

- Some instruction forms do not handle I/O and will produce a breakpoint
  trap if used that way.  Use -i to ignore them, and send me a bug report
  if you encounter this problem.

- The following instuctions do not check for mapper writes: ASL LSR ROL ROR

- I suspect that the sprite code isn't completely correct; please tell me
  if you know what the problem is.

- Mirroring of the internal 2K RAM is not emulated.

- Doesn't implement the 6502 wrap-around bug (I really doubt that this
  would make a difference)

- Video code needs to be optimized for speed (TuxNES supports a range
  of video output options)

- No sound (TuxNES fully supports NES sound)

- No PAL mode (I don't have any games that need it)

- MMC2 support is incomplete (fixed in TuxNES)

- Needs more mappers - submissions are welcome! (TuxNES supports quite a few
  more mappers)
